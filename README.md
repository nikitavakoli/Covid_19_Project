# COVID-19 Spread Racing Bar Chart
In this project, I created a racing bar chart of US states acquiring confirmed COVID-19 cases from January (01/22/2020) to June 2020 coded using Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib. This visualization of the change in confirmed cases each day from the beginning of this historic, global pandemic is vital in being able to understand the severity and rapid spread of this virus.
